## Overview
This project consisted of creating a visually appealing qr-component from barebones html. With my solution it required the use of flexbox and other foundational css elements. Completing this project has helped with furthering my understanding as well as developing my practical skills in html and css.

### What I learned

Initially I had struggled alot with formating the qr-code-component to be in the center of the page and to look like the reference image. However eventually I was able to obtain the wanted result by messing around with flexbox and changing the min-height value of the container class. Overall I felt like this project was of the right level of challenge where I am not breezing through it and am not getting constantly stuck. This was helpful as it provided strong practive in terms of html and css.


### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to focus more on practicing and getting better with flexbox aswell as improving my skills when it comes to making components and the overall website more responsive. Generally I would also aim to improve my fluidity with css, and in a sense be able to understand what needs to be done in order to achieve a certain result.
